# **Sports Card Investor Dev Challenge**

Welcome to the Sports Card Investor Dev Challenge! This task mimics real-world scenarios you’d tackle in our projects, focusing on creating a dynamic and user-friendly card application. Let's see how you solve problems, structure code, and think creatively.

---

## **Challenge Overview**

Your task is to enhance and fix a provided card listing application, making it more engaging and user-friendly. The application should:

1. **Work like [this example](https://jam.dev/c/5bbe3b26-56e4-4778-9f35-ed188e35f096)**:
   - A dropdown filters cards based on health points (HP).
   - Cards can be sorted dynamically using buttons.
   - Fetch card data via an API and display it attractively.

2. **Add exciting animations to the cards**:
   - Use a library like [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) or your choice of CSS animations.
   - Animations could include hover effects, transitions when cards are sorted, or loading animations.

3. **Address existing lint and test errors**:
   - You might encounter ESLint or Jest errors that prevent the application from running.
   - Fix or suppress these errors as appropriate to ensure a clean development environment.

## **Deliverables**

### Submit the following:

1. A link to your **GitHub repository** containing the completed project.
2. **Instructions** on how to run the application locally, included in the `README.md`.

---

## Instructions 

1. Use NPM Install on root directory to install libraries
2. Use NPM Run Build to build the project
3. Use NPM Run Start to start the project on localhost 

## **What We're Looking For**

Your submission will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. **Problem-Solving Approach**:
   - How do you tackle the various aspects of building and fixing this feature?

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Is your code readable, maintainable, and scalable?

3. **API Handling**:
   - Are data fetching, caching, and state updates handled efficiently?

4. **User Experience**:
   - Are dropdown interactions, data loading, and sorting operations smooth?

5. **Communication**:
   - Keep us updated on your thought process! Share any roadblocks, cool discoveries, or questions you encounter.

## **Extra Credit**

Go the extra mile by implementing the following:

- **Dark Mode Support**:
  - Add a toggle that switches the app to a dark theme.

- **Debounce User Input**:
  - Implement input debouncing to avoid excessive API calls when typing in a search field.
